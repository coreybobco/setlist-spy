  <p>I am a web application developer with 2 years of professional experience in an agile, team-based corporate environment currently
  seeking opportunities in the greater Austin area.

  <p>On this site you w1ll find a <a ng-href="#/mutagen">text generator</a> that allows you to mix and match together books from Project Gutenberg's library
  and randomly generate text from their corpora with some customization options.</p>

  <p>You can also check out my visual series <a ng-href="#/art">If Who Painted What</a>, which I created using existing machine learning algorithms for artistic style transfer.
